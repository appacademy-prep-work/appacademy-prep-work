# Next Step: Technical Interview

## Purpose of the Interview
App Academy is an intense bootcamp. Students who have a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills tend to thrive in this bootcamp environment.

Thus, the goal of this interview is to assess your comprehension of key coding concepts and how you solve problems to ensure you are prepared for the bootcamp.
&nbsp;
## What we are looking for
App Academy has a Selections team that reviews applicants and their interviews in order to determine their readiness for the bootcamp. You will be assessed in this technical interview on a number of criteria:
 * ### **Attitude**
    * While it’s normal to be nervous, we want to see your personality shine in this interview. Students who are engaged and project positive emotion tend to work well with other students in the bootcamp.
 * ### **Professionalism**
    * This interview should be taken seriously. We are preparing you for the working world, so we need to see you can carry yourself professionally.
 * ### **Understanding problems**
    * We need to see that you can break problems down to reach a solution.
 * ### **Explaining strategy and code**
    * You need to be able to verbally walk through your intended strategy for the problem and the code leading up to your solution.
 * ### **Coding ability**
    * We will assess your ability to write code fluidly, your ability successfully implement a working solution and your ability to walkthrough code with an example proving your understanding of how the code will evaluate.
 * ### **Debugging skills**
    * You should be able to see ahead of time what areas of your code will not work and fix them accordingly. Ideally running the code and analyzing terminal output should be your last resort.
    * If you “run” the code and come across any errors, you should be able to decipher the terminal output as well as locate the error. We would like to see you communicate how to solve the error and what your new expected output should be.
 * ### **Pairing**
    * Part of your interview will include working  with your interviewer to solve a problem (“pairing”). This will assess your overall ability to communicate and collaborate well with others. Much of your time at App Academy will be spent pair programming.

## How the interview works
The interview consists of three problems: two solo prompts and one pair programming prompt. Each problem will have a 15 minute time limit to solve it. You can do the interview using Ruby, JavaScript, or Python.

Your Admissions Specialist will provide you with the link to schedule your interview through YouCanBook.Me (a scheduling platform).

On the day of your interview, no less than three minutes before the start time, you will receive an email from one of our interviewers with the link to join them in [HackerRank][hackerR]’s CodePair platform.

CodePair is a browser-based pairing platform that we will use to conduct the interview. It is located on the [HackerRank][hackerR] website. To get into the interview, you will simply open the link from your interviewer in a web browser (preferably Google Chrome or FireFox). You will need a steady internet connection and a working microphone and webcam for the interview.

Once you open the link, your interviewer will give you instructions to read over, and then you will start the interview.
&nbsp;
## Solo Prompts
The first two problems you work on will be solo prompts. These are problems that you solve on your own in front of the interviewer - the interviewer will take notes on how you solve them.

You will be expected to explain your strategy out loud before you begin coding.

As you code, you should verbally walk through each line of code for your interviewer and provide insight into what you are doing and why. Explain your logic. Code with intention.

When you have finished coding your solution, verbally step through each line of code using a test case. When you feel comfortable with your solution, you can ask permission to run your code to verify your code works.
&nbsp;
## Pairing Prompt
The last problem you will work on will be a pair programming prompt. Pair programming is working together with another programmer in order to solve a problem - this is something we do a lot of at App Academy!

Pairing in the interview will be broken down into the separate roles: navigating and driving. You will be assessed on your ability to do both.
* ### **Navigating**
    * You are responsible for thinking through the overall strategy of how to solve the problem and communicating your strategy to your partner. You will provide high-level verbal instructions to your partner in order to guide them through the problem.
    * You should ensure your partner is on the same page as you at all times.

 * ### **Driving**
    * You are responsible for listening to your partner and following their instructions. You will physically type out code in the CodePair text editor. You should make sure you understand the code that you are being asked to type - ask any clarifying questions and double check your understanding.
    * Avoid typing ahead of the instructions your partner is giving you. Be respectful and wait for instructions before typing.
