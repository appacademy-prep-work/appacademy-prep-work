# Next Step: Non-Tech Interview

* ### What to expect?
   * A 30 minute interview conducted via [Zoom]. Requires a steady internet connection and functional webcam. Will be recorded for evaluation and quality assurance purposes. Come prepared to deliver your personal pitch and answer some interview questions. We want to hear all things you and how we can help you reach your goals!

* ### What are we looking for?
    * **Professionalism.**
    * **English language proficiency.**
    * **Enthusiasm and Positive energy.**
    * **Examples of your resilience and work ethic.**
    * **Examples of your ability to work on a team.**
    * **Examples of how your experiences have prepared you for the rigors of App Academy.**
    * **Examples of any time you have spent with code. What resources you have used to learn and/or your learning style.**
    * **An openness to diversity.**

* ### How much coding experience should I have?
    * If you are applying to our 16 week program, you should have strong fundamentals in at least one programming language. A good gauge for when you are ready to apply is when you can confidently solve these [practice problems] on your own.
    * If you are applying for our 24 week program we want to see that you have spent at least a few days playing around with code to ensure that you actually enjoy working with code and programming. You will have to demonstrate more than a love for technology. What draws you to Software Engineering specifically?

* ### What is a personal pitch? How should one be structured?
    * Your personal pitch is a 2-3 minute spiel about you and your background. It should provide your interviewer with insight into your educational and professional background, how you got introduced to code or Software engineering and why you have decided to pursue App Academy over any other bootcamp.

| **What to do...** |**What not to do...**|
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Have a personal pitch prepared. | Leave the interviewer confused about why you are interested in App Academy and software engineering.|
| Breathe, smile, sit up straight, and make eye contact. Your body language helps to convey your confidence and your enthusiasm.| Ramble or go on long tangents, mumble, slouch, avoid eye contact.|
| Demonstrate your enthusiasm for programming, Software engineering and why App Academy is the right fit for you.| Give vague, generic answers that don’t speak to your specific experiences.|
| Be mindful of filler words (um,like,so,and). It’s ok to take pauses as you formulate your thoughts.| Talk negatively about yourself or others.|
| Be mindful of what’s in the view of your background and present yourself the way you would in a professional interview setting.|Take the interview in a dark room, your car, a cafe, or a chaotic environment. Vape, smoke, or eat.|
|Focus on the positive. Don’t put yourself or others down. Reframe setbacks in your life as opportunities for growth.| Overshare personal information. Frame your success in terms of being better than others.|
