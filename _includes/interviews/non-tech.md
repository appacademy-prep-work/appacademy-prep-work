# Next Step: Behavioral Interview

## Purpose of the Interview
App Academy is an intense, challenging bootcamp. Not every student thrives in this kind of environment. The goal of this interview is to gauge whether you are a good fit for App Academy -- and whether we are a good fit for you!

The interview will be similar to a job interview so that we can assess your professionalism, readiness for the rigor of the bootcamp, and overall preparedness for the job search.

## How the interview works
Your Admissions Specialist will provide you with the link to schedule your interview through YouCanBook.Me (a scheduling platform).
&nbsp;
On the day of your interview, no less than 3 minutes before the start time, you will receive an email from one of our interviewers with the link to join them in a Zoom meeting.
&nbsp;
The interview will be approximately 30 minutes long and will be conducted via Zoom. To complete the interview, you will need the following:
  * Zoom account
  * Steady internet connection
  * Microphone
  * Webcam

Once you join the interview, the interviewer will introduce themselves and then ask you questions. Afterwards, you will get a chance to ask the interviewer any questions you might have.

Our interviewers are recent App Academy graduates, many of whom work part-time during their job search..Your interviewer is a great person to ask about the App Academy experience!

## What we are looking for
App Academy has a selections team that reviews applicants and their interviews in order to determine their readiness for the bootcamp. Your entire application will be reviewed, and you will be assessed on a number of criteria:
* Professionalism
  * We are preparing you for the working world, so we need to see you can carry yourself professionally.
* English language proficiency
  * Your instructors will teach in English and your peers will speak English during the course. You need professional working English language proficiency to be successful.
* Passion for coding
  * This is a stressful bootcamp, and a passion for coding will greatly improve your ability to handle the intensity of our bootcamp.
* Understanding of software engineering
  * This is not a “get rich quick” scheme: we are not going to hand you a job after graduation. You need to understand what you are getting yourself into and make sure this is the career path you want.
* Enthusiasm and positive energy
  * We want to hear about why you are excited about coding, potentially attending App Academy, and becoming a software engineer. We also want to see that you can speak positively about yourself and your experiences, as these are qualities that employers are looking for.
* Resiliency and work ethic
  * Time management, stress management, and a strong drive are necessary to thrive in the program
* Ability to work well on a team
  * Approximately half of your day will be spent pair-programming, so you will need to be able to work well with your partners to succeed.
* Openness to diversity
  * App Academy has students from a diverse set of backgrounds. One of our core values is creating a positive, inclusive environment for all students, particularly those from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the tech field. We expect all students to treat each other with empathy and respect.

- Breathe, smile, sit up straight, and make eye contact.
